# MIPS assembler
Given an input file and mode this program assembles or disassembles the given file and writes it to provided output file.

## Usage
This program is a Command-Line based program. Its parameters are as follows:
- `m` or `--mode`: Whether you want to read an assembly file and disassemble its content. The options are `A` for an assembler and `D` for a disassembler.

- `i` or `--input`: Path to the file to be opened.

- `o` or `--output`: Path for the output file, which the program is going to write to.

- `h` or `--help`: Help menu.

### Example:
```main.py i input_file.asm o output_file.hex m a```


## Input and output specifications
For instructions, it is required that the numbers to be in decimal format. Machine code generated by this code is going to be in Hexs format.

## Supported Instructions for assembler

- `add`: addition of registers
- `addi`: addition of a register and an immediate
- `and`: AND of registers
- `andi`: AND of a register and an immidate
- `or`: OR of registers
- `ori`: OR of a register and an immidate
- `sub`: subtraction of regiters
- `sll`: shift logical left of a register
- `srl`: shift logical right of a register
- `lw`: loading a word into a register
- `lui`: loading an immidate into the upper half of a register
- `slt`: set less than for registers
- `sw`: save word
- `slti`: set less than for a register and an immidate
- `beq`: branch equal to
- `bne`: branch not equal to
- `jal`: jump an link
- `jr`: jump to return address
- `j`: jump to address
